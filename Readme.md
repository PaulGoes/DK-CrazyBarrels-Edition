# Donkey Kong Crazy Barrels Edition

This is a rom-hack of the original arcade Donkey Kong game.

In this Crazy Barrels Edition you play the barrels screen over and over again. But the internal difficulty starts where the original stops: at level 5. In this game this is called the Agitation Level of Donkey Kong, displayed on the screen as A=5. When a barrel screen is cleared, the Agitation Level goes up for the next screen. But this is not the only change. Donkey Kong throws a lot more crazy barrels than the original game. Just like the original game, the first barrel is always a crazy barrel that ignites the oil can and spawns a fireball. In the original game the second barrel is never a crazy barrel, but in this game it might be. The game is hard and Donkey Kong shows that by yelling 'You won't get that high!'. But he has a little remorse and gives you 6 lives instead of 3.
