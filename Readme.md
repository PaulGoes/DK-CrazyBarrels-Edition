# Donkey Kong Crazy Barrels Edition

This is a rom-hack of the original arcade Donkey Kong game.

In this Crazy Barrels Edition you play the barrels screen over and over again. But the internal difficulty starts where the original stops: at level 5. In this game this is called the Agitation Level of Donkey Kong, displayed on the screen as A=5. When a barrel screen is cleared, the Agitation Level goes up for the next screen. But this is not the only change. Donkey Kong throws a lot more crazy barrels than the original game. Just like the original game, the first barrel is always a crazy barrel that ignites the oil can and spawns a fireball. In the original game the second barrel is never a crazy barrel, but in this game it might be. The game is hard and Donkey Kong shows that by yelling 'You won't get that high!'. But he has a little remorse and gives you 6 lives instead of 3.

There are two ways to play this rom-hack:

- Play in an emulator that supports the rom-hack. Currently Homebrew Mame (HBMame) and Libretro FB Neo (lr-fbneo) support the game. Use the dkcbarrel.zip and place it in the appropriate rom location. On RetroPie you must use the lr-fbneo emulator to play the rom-hack. You might have to update Retropie lr-fbneo from source to get the most recent version of the emulator.

- On most other emulators (e.g. WolfMame) you can play this game by replacing the original dkong.zip by this Crazy Barrels version of the dkong.zip. You have to start the emulator without checksum checking (in WolfMame by starting it from the command line and specifying the romname).
